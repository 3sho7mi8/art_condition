  name: STANDINGPINE
  note: |
    Standing Pine was founded in 2009 in Nagoya, Japan. It mainly supports emerging Japanese artists and focuses on promoting an emerging value of media art including sound, video, photography, installation and so on. It represents works which themselves contain an aesthetic beauty and an intrinsic attention to fine detail and technique that is seen as typically Japanese, yet with a strong concept and significant messages to the modern society, hidden and embedded behind it.
